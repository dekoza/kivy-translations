msgid "This is by far the easiest way to contribute something. If you're using Kivy for your own project, don't hesitate sharing. It doesn't have to be a high-class enterprise app, obviously. It's just incredibly motivating to know that people use the things you develop and what it enables them to do. If you have something that you would like to tell us, please don't hesitate. Screenshots and videos are also very welcome! We're also interested in the problems you had when getting started. Please feel encouraged to report any obstacles you encountered such as missing documentation, misleading directions or similar. We are perfectionists, so even if it's just a typo, let us know."

The `Git Community Book <http://book.git-scm.com/>`_ or the `Git Screencasts <http://gitcasts.com/>`_ are both great ways to learn git. Trust us when we say that git is a great tool. It may seem daunting at first, but after a while you'll (hopefully) love it as much as we do. Teaching you git, however, is well beyond the scope of this document."
