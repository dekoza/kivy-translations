msgid "Sometimes your application requires functionality that is beyond the scope of what Kivy can deliver. In those cases it is necessary to resort to external software libraries. Given the richness of the Python ecosystem, there is already a great number of software libraries that you can simply import and use right away."

msgid "For some third-party libraries, it's not as easy as that though. Some libraries require special *wrappers* being written for them to be compatible with Kivy. Some libraries might even need to be patched so that they can be used (e.g. if they open their own OpenGL context to draw in and don't support proper offscreen rendering). In those occasions it is often possible to patch the library in question and to provide a Python wrapper around it that is compatible with Kivy. Sticking with this example, you can't just use the wrapper with a 'normal' installation of the library because the patch would be missing."

msgid "That is where Kivy extensions come in handy. A Kivy extension represents a single third-party library that is provided in a way so that it can simply be downloaded as a single file, put in a special directory and then offers the functionality of the wrapped library to Kivy applications. These extensions will not pollute the global Python environment (as they might be unusable on their own after potential patches have been applied) because they reside in special directories for Kivy that are not accessed by Python by default."

msgid "With Kivy's extension system, your application can use specially packaged third-party libraries in a backwards compatible way (by specifying the version that you require) even if the actual third-party library does not guarantee backwards-compatibility. There will be no breakage if newer versions are installed (as a properly suited old version will still be used). For more information about that behaviour, consider the documentation of the :func:`~kivy.ext.load` function."

msgid "Use this function to tell Kivy to load a specific version of the given Extension. This is different from kivy's require() in that it will always use the exact same major version you specify, even if a newer (major) version is available. This is because we cannot make the same backwards-compatibility guarantee that we make with Kivy for third-party extensions. You will still get fixes and optimizations that don't break backwards compatibility via minor version upgrades of the extension."

msgid "A tuple of the form (major, minor), where major and minor are ints that specify the major and minor version number for the extension, e.g. (1, 2) would be akin to 1.2. It is important to note that between minor versions, backwards compatibility is guaranteed, but between major versions it is not. I.e. if you change your extension in a backwards incompatible way, increase the major version number (and reset the minor to 0). If you just do a bug fix or add an optional, backwards-compatible feature, you can just increase the minor version number. If the application then requires version (1, 2), every version starting with that version number will be ok and by default the latest version will be choosen. The two ints major and minor can both be in range(0, infinity)."
