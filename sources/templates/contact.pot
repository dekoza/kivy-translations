If there is no issue yet that matches your inquiry, feel free to create a new one. Please make sure you receive the mails that github sends if we comment on the issue in case we need more information. For bugs, please provide all the information necessary, like the operating system you're using, the **full error message** or any other logs, a description what you did to trigger the bug and what the actual bug was, and anything else that might be of interest. We can only help if you precisely tell us what the actual problem is, obviously."

If you just join, ask and quit we have **no way** of knowing who you were and where we're supposed to send our answer to. Also, keep in mind we're mostly based in Europe, so take into account any timezone issues. If you're unlucky more than once, try the mailing list."
