msgid "We try not to reinvent the wheel but bring something innovative to the market. As a consequence, we're focused on our own code and use already existing, high-qualitative third-party libraries where possible. For the rich set of features that Kivy offers, several other libraries are required. If you do not use a specific feature (e.g. video playback) you don't need the corresponding dependency, however. That said, there is one dependency that Kivy **does** require: `Cython <http://cython.org>`_."
