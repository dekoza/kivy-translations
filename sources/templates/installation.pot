msgid "We try not to reinvent the wheel but bring something innovative to the market. As a consequence, we're focused on our own code and use already existing, high-qualitative third-party libraries where possible. For the rich set of features that Kivy offers, several other libraries are required. If you do not use a specific feature (e.g. video playback) you don't need the corresponding dependency, however. That said, there is one dependency that Kivy **does** require: `Cython <http://cython.org>`_."

msgid "On Windows we have to ship our own version of Python since it's not installed by default on Windows (unlike Mac OS X and Linux). By following the steps above, you will set Kivy's version of Python as the default for opening .py files for your user. Normally this should not be harmful as it's just a normal version of Python with the :ref:`necessary third party libraries <winpackagecontents>` added to the module search path. If you do encounter unexpected problems, please :ref:`contact`."
